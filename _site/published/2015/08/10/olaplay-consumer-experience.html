<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ola Play is the world’s most advanced connected car platform. It brings advanced car controls, choice of personalized content, and a fully connected interactive experience to the user. Cars are equipped with a range of infotainment options and enhanced driver assistance.</p>

<p>Users can tune into their favourite radio shows, catch up on sitcoms, enjoy movies and much more. Going home, to work, or maybe heading to the airport, users can enjoy comfortable rides with entertainment on-the-go.</p>

<h2 id="context--research">Context &amp; Research</h2>

<p>As of 2017, the consumer experience was limited to watching videos and listening to music during the ride. We planned to scale this beyond music, movies into gaming, localised content and commerce. Some of the problems we identified and plan to solve for were as follows-</p>

<p><strong>It was very hard for users to discover new and personalised content - </strong>
To help with the launch, the consumer tablet always showcased content partner apps on the home screen. This was a thoughtful measure to bring about familiarity in content to this new “in-car experience” for Indian consumers. However, as content and number of Play rides scaled, this proved to be a bottleneck for new content discovery by users. Most users would stick to one or two channels that they recognized which lead to a very narrow spread in engagement.</p>

<p><strong>The V1 interface was not scalable for non-media use cases, like commerce and gaming - </strong>
The Version 1 of consumer tablet experience was designed for consuming music and video during a cab ride and the navigation was failing to scale beyond entertainment and cater to newer product segments such as local commerce and in-car gaming.</p>

<p><strong>Low scores on perceived safety from users - </strong>
Repeated user surveys and interviews suggested low scores on perceived safety in Ola cabs. As a part of the overall organisational effort, we had to enable quick and easy access to emergency controls in OlaPlay cabs as well.</p>

<p><strong>Low scores on brand awareness+recall for Ola Play - </strong>
Numerous user interviews with the larger share of Ola’s customers revealed that many people were not aware of this category of cabs equipped with entertainment consoles. Our research team also deduced that the interface did not have many cues that strengthened OlaPlay’s brand. This made users slightly apathetic towards repeated booking of OlaPlay cabs.</p>

<p><strong>No efforts towards personalising the ride for the user - </strong>
User research also indicated that there was a gap in the experience that when bridged could make each OlaPlay ride magical and a personal one.</p>

<p><strong>Searching for content was hard on an in-car setup - </strong>
We conducted usability tests by accompanying some users on a cab ride and quickly found out that simple tasks like searching, typing on a tablet was taxing and prone to errors while sitting on the back-seat of a car.</p>

<p>During the last 12 months, I led a team of 2 product designers and 2 UX researchers on the redesign of the in-cab consumer experience.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="design--prototyping">Design &amp; Prototyping</h2>

<p>First order of business for the design team was to empathise and understand the situations and moods of daily commuters on Ola. They were often stuck in a cab for hours, either on daily commutes between home &lt;&gt; office or those long and boring rides to the airport.</p>

<p>The cab rides would often be subjected to harsh traffic noise and bumpy Indian roads, making it even harder for users to interact on a touch device. We had to internalise our learnings on the discomfort of interacting with a tablet from the backseat of a car, which is 2 feet away.</p>

<p>###So what constitutes a great in-cab experience at 2 feet?</p>

<p>Entertainment UI should offer effortless navigation and control, keeping the user’s focus on content. At 2 feet, this was twice as important. We wanted users to sit back and enjoy without having to lean front and touch often to make decisions. We had to study and take cues from the in-home TV experience for android and apple TVs and retrofit them in the context of a moving cab.</p>

<p>In brief, the redesign involves and advocates for ‘design for distance’ by minimizing text inputs and having a content first approach.</p>

<p>The redesigned UI allows zero typing by the user. Most common tasks like searching and typing queries would now be handled by an omnipresent voice search assistant. Ola partnered with Microsoft and the engineering team worked on deep integration of Cortana services, enabling users to perform system-wide voice searches easily.</p>
