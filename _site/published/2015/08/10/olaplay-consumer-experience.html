<p>Ola Play is one of the world’s most advanced connected car platforms. It brings advanced car controls, choice of personalized content, and a fully connected interactive experience to its customers. Sedan cabs are equipped with a range of infotainment options and enhanced driver assistance.</p>

<p>Customers can tune into their favourite radio shows, catch up on sitcoms, enjoy movies and much more. Going home, to work, or maybe heading to the airport, Ola’s customers enjoyed and loved these comfortable rides with entertainment on-the-go.</p>

<h2 id="research--context">Research &amp; Context</h2>

<p>As of 2017, the consumer experience was limited to watching videos and listening to music during the ride. The team at OlaPlay identified our unique positioning as a consumer service. We planned to scale the in-cab experience beyond entertainment into gaming &amp; hyperlocal commerce. Over a period of one year, the product, operations and research teams gathered much feedback regarding limitations of the existing design and offerings. Some of the key observations and problems we identified in user interviews were as follows-</p>

<p><strong>Customers were unable to discover new and personalised content - </strong>
To help with the launch, the consumer device always showcased content partner apps on the home screen. This was a thoughtful measure to exploit familiarity in content to this new “in-car experience” for Indian consumers. However, as content and number of daily OlaPlay rides scaled, this proved to be a bottleneck for new content discovery by users. Most users would stick to one or two channels that they recognized which lead to a very narrow spread in engagement.</p>

<p><strong>The V1 interface was not scalable for non-media use cases, like commerce and gaming - </strong>
The initial design of consumer tablet experience was designed for consumption of music and video during a cab ride and the navigation was failing to scale beyond entertainment and cater to newer product segments such as local commerce and in-car gaming.</p>

<p><strong>Surveys indicated low scores on perceived safety from customers - </strong>
Repeated user surveys and interviews suggested low scores on perceived safety in Ola’s cabs. As a part of the overall organisational effort, we had to enable quick and easy access to emergency controls in OlaPlay cabs as well, giving safety tools and empowering customers on their safety.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing surveys showed low scores on brand awareness+recall for Ola Play - </strong>
Numerous user interviews with the larger share of Ola’s customers revealed that many people were not aware of this category of cabs equipped with entertainment consoles. Our research team also deduced that the interface did not have many cues that strengthened OlaPlay’s brand. This made users slightly apathetic towards repeated booking of OlaPlay cabs.</p>

<p><strong>Usability issues on the back-seat of a car - </strong>
Our research team conducted usability tests by accompanying some users on a cab ride and quickly found out that simple tasks like searching, typing on a tablet was taxing on the arm muscles and prone to errors while sitting on the back-seat of a car.</p>

<p>During 2018, I led a team of 2 product designers and 2 UX researchers on the redesign of the in-cab consumer experience.</p>

<h2 id="design--prototyping">Design &amp; Prototyping</h2>

<p>First order of business for the design team was to empathise and understand the situations and moods of daily commuters on Ola. They were often stuck in a cab for hours, either on daily commutes between home &lt;&gt; office or those long and boring rides to the airport.</p>

<p>The cab rides would often be subjected to harsh traffic noise and bumpy Indian roads, making it even harder for users to interact on a touch device. We had to internalise our learnings on the discomfort of interacting with a tablet device from the backseat of a car, which is 2 feet away.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-constitutes-a-great-in-cab-experience-at-a-distance-of-2-feet">So what constitutes a great in-cab experience, at a distance of 2 feet?</h3>

<p>Entertainment UI should offer effortless navigation and control, keeping the user’s focus on content. At 2 feet, this was twice as important. We wanted users to sit back and enjoy without having to lean front and touch often to make decisions. We had to study and take cues from the in-home TV experience for android and apple TVs and retrofit them in the context of a moving cab.</p>

<p>In brief, the redesign involves and advocates for ‘design for distance’ by minimizing text inputs and having a content first approach.</p>

<p>The redesigned UI asks for zero typing by the user. Most common tasks like searching and typing queries would now be handled by an omnipresent voice search assistant. Ola partnered with Microsoft and the engineering team worked on deep integration of Cortana services into the OlaPlay plaform, enabling users to perform system-wide voice searches easily.</p>
