<p><a href="http://framerjs.com"><strong>FramerJS</strong></a> is a tool to design interactive high-fidelity prototypes for iOS, Android, desktop, or the web. A few months ago at OlaPlay, we had to figure out a way to make prototypes that could send data to each other and framer seemed like a good fit since it is web-based and can make use of websockets. I wrote about it here - <a href="https://blog.framer.com/making-framer-prototypes-talk-to-each-other-web-sockets-framer-85eedd2243aa"><strong>Making Framer Prototypes that talk to each other</strong></a></p>

<p>Once we were comfortable with the websocket and communications setup, we could imagine features and use-cases that could be served within the backseat of the cab.</p>

<p>This is a framer prototype that we later turned into an internal web-tool for our content team at OlaPlay. It captures a palette of the most dominant colors from images. I worked closely with our marketing designer to come up with a relatively easy logic that could generate album-artworks on the fly. This helped us take this manual load off the designerâ€™s schedule and let them work on more important stuff.</p>

<p>At OlaPlay, I was trying to make prototyping quick and easy for other designers on the team. We wanted to think in terms of locations and maps. We made use of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox GL JS API</a> and templatized most functions like drawing pins on the map and use the google directions API and draw a navigable route between two points and have a cab/icon follow the route. Designers could then import these into their own framer files and start designing on top of this, prototyping booking flows and micro-animations on the map.</p>

<p>Making use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation"> MDN web APIs </a> I was quickly able to make a bottom menu interaction. Using the device rotation, we can open and close the menu by setting a threshold.</p>

<p>Tried out prototyping a VR Scene in Framer. Imagined users taking a VR tour of the room before deciding to book it.</p>

<p>Learnt about creating a scene based on cubemaps and much more. Big thanks to @Jonas Treub for providing the VRComponent.</p>
